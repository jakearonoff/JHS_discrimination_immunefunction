Analysis code for study testing associations between perceived discrimination and the prevalence of different immune cell types in the Jackson Heart Study

Aronoff, J. E., Quinn, E. B., Forde, A. T., Glover, L. M., Reiner, A., McDade, T. W., & Sims, M. (2022). Associations between perceived discrimination and immune cell composition in the Jackson Heart Study. Brain, behavior, and immunity, S0889-1591.

The analysis code file shows example code for how I modeled the data and generated tables and figures. The bioinformatics code file shows the pipeline I used to process DNAm data and estimate lymphocyte %'s and markers of immune system aging. Edward Quinn (PhD student, University of Florida, https://anthro.ufl.edu/2018/09/16/edwardquinn/) gave me significant help and code for the bioinformatics.
