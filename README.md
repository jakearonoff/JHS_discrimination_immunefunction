Analysis code for study testing associations between perceived discrimination and the prevalence of different immune cell types (paper in revision)

The analysis code file shows example code for how I modeled the data and generated tables and figures. The bioinformatics code file shows the pipeline I used to process DNAm data and estimate lymphocyte %'s and markers of immune system aging. Edward Quinn (PhD student, University of Florida, https://anthro.ufl.edu/2018/09/16/edwardquinn/) gave me significant help and code for the bioinformatics.
