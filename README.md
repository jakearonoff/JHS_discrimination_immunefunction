Analysis code for study testing associations between perceived discrimination and innate vs adaptive immune function (paper in prep)

The analysis code file shows how I transformed certain variables and the models I used that produced the paper results. The bioinformatics code file shows the pipeline I used to process DNAm data and estimate lymphocyte %'s and markers of immune system againg. Edward Quinn (PhD student, University of Florida, https://anthro.ufl.edu/2018/09/16/edwardquinn/) gave me significant help and code for the bioinformatics.
